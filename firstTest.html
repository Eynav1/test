          A bicycle, also called a pedal cycle, bike or cycle, is a human-powered or motor-powered assisted, pedal-driven,
           single-track vehicle, having two wheels attached to a frame, one behind the other. A bicycle rider is called a cyclist,
            or bicyclist.

        Bicycles were introduced in the 19th century in Europe. By the early 21st century, more than 1 billion were in existence
        .<sup>[1][2][3]</sup> These numbers far exceed the number of cars,
         both in total and ranked by the number of individual models produced
         .<sup>[4][5][6]</sup> They are the principal means of transportation in many regions.
          They also provide a popular form of recreation, and have been adapted for use as children's toys,
           general fitness, military and police applications, courier services, bicycle racing, and bicycle stunts.</p>

        <h2 id="Etymology">Etymology</h2>
        <p>The word bicycle first appeared in English print in The Daily News in 1868,
             to describe "Bysicles and trysicles" on the "Champs Elysées and Bois de Boulogne".
             <sup>[12]</sup> The word was first used in 1847 in a French publication to describe an unidentified
              two-wheeled vehicle, possibly a carriage.<sup>[12]</sup> The design of the bicycle was an advance on the velocipede,
               although the words were used with some degree of overlap for a time.</p>

        <p>The "dandy horse",<sup>[19]</sup> also called Draisienne or Laufmaschine ("running machine"),
             was the first human means of transport to use only two wheels in tandem and was invented
              by the German Baron Karl von Drais. It is regarded as the first bicycle, but it did not have pedals;
              <sup>[20][21][22][23]</sup> Drais introduced it to the public in Mannheim in 1817 and in Paris in 1818.
              <sup>[24][25]</sup> Its rider sat astride a wooden frame supported by two in-line wheels and pushed the 
              vehicle along with his or her feet while steering the front wheel.</p>

            class="HISTimg">
        <p>The first mechanically propelled, two-wheeled vehicle may have been built by Kirkpatrick MacMillan,
             a Scottish blacksmith, in 1839, although the claim is often disputed.<sup>[26]</sup>
              He is also associated with the first recorded instance of a cycling traffic offense,
               when a Glasgow newspaper in 1842 reported an accident in which an anonymous 
               "gentleman from Dumfries-shire... bestride a velocipede... of ingenious design"
                knocked over a little girl in Glasgow and was fined five shillings (equivalent to £24 in 2020).</p>

        <h2 id="Uses">Uses</h2>
        <p>From the beginning and still today, bicycles have been and are employed for many uses.
             In a utilitarian way, bicycles are used for transportation, bicycle commuting, and utility cycling.
              It can be used as a 'work horse', used by mail carriers, paramedics, police, messengers,
             and general delivery services. Military uses of bicycles include communications,
             reconnaissance, troop movement, supply of provisions, and patrol. See also: bicycle infantry.</p>

    <div class="Technical aspects">
        <h2 id="Technical aspects">Technical aspects</h2>
        <p>The bicycle has undergone continual adaptation and improvement since its inception.
             These innovations have continued with the advent of modern materials and computer-aided design,
              allowing for a proliferation of specialized bicycle types, improved bicycle safety, and riding comfort</p>
        <p><h3 id="Types">Types</h3>Bicycles can be categorized in many different ways:
             by function, by number of riders, by general construction, by gearing or by means of propulsion.
              The more common types include utility bicycles, mountain bicycles, racing bicycles, touring bicycles,
               hybrid bicycles, cruiser bicycles, and BMX bikes. Less common are tandems, low riders,
                tall bikes, fixed gear, folding models, amphibious bicycles, cargo bikes, recumbents and electric bicycles.

            Unicycles, tricycles and quadracycles are not strictly bicycles, as they have respectively one,
             three and four wheels, but are often referred to informally as "bikes" or "cycles".</p>
        <p><h3 id="Dynamics">Dynamics</h3>A bicycle stays upright while moving forward by being steered
             so as to keep its center of mass over the wheels.[40] This steering is usually provided by the rider,
              but under certain conditions may be provided by the bicycle itself.[41]

            The combined center of mass of a bicycle and its rider must lean into a turn
             to successfully navigate it. This lean is induced by a method known as countersteering,
              which can be performed by the rider turning the handlebars directly with the hands[42]
               or indirectly by leaning the bicycle.[43]</p>
        <p><h3 id="Performance">Performance</h3>The bicycle is extraordinarily efficient in both biological and mechanical terms.
             The bicycle is the most efficient human-powered means of transportation in terms of energy a person must expend to travel
              a given distance.[45] From a mechanical viewpoint, up to 99% of the energy delivered by the rider into the pedals is
               transmitted to the wheels, although the use of gearing mechanisms may reduce this by 10–15%.[46][47] In terms of the
                ratio of cargo weight a bicycle can carry to total weight, it is also an efficient means of cargo transportation.

            A human traveling on a bicycle at low to medium speeds of around 16–24 km/h (10–15 mph) uses only the power 
            required to walk. Air drag, which is proportional to the square of speed, requires dramatically higher power outputs
             as speeds increase. If the rider is sitting upright, the rider's body creates about 75% of the total drag of the bicycle/rider
              combination. Drag can be reduced by seating the rider in a more aerodynamically streamlined position. Drag can also be reduced 
              by covering the bicycle with an aerodynamic fairing. The fastest recorded unpaced speed on a
               flat surface is 144.18 km/h (89.59 mph)</p>
